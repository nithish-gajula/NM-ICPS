In c programming, arrays are linear data structures with static memory allocation, that means the size of array can not be changed at runtime.
An array is a collection of similar data types which are stored in memory as a contiguous memory block.
The size of the array is based on the datatype of that array

Example 1 :

    int a[5];
    a[0] = 1;
    a[1] = 2;
    a[2] = 3;
    a[3] = 4;
    a[4] = 5;

Example 2 :

    int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
    int b[9] = {1,2,3};

    for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
        printf("%d\n",a[i]);
    }

Example 3 :

    /adfhafk

In the Example 2, the array b is of size 9, but it is filled with only 3 elements, so other remaining elements are initially filled with 0

If you want to print the size of array :

    int a[5]={1,2,3,4,5};
    int b[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
    int size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);  // result will be 100
    int size = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);  // result will be 8

If you want the no.of elements present in an array :
