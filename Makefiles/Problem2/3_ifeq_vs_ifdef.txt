In a makefile, the ifeq and ifdef directives are used to conditionally evaluate parts of the makefile based on certain conditions. Here's an explanation of the differences between "ifeq" and "ifdef"


1) ifeq:
The ifeq directive is used to compare two values for equality. It allows you to conditionally execute certain parts of the makefile based on the result of the comparison. 

example syntax:
ifeq (condition, value)
    # Statements to execute if the condition is true
else
    # Statements to execute if the condition is false
endif



2. ifdef:
The ifdef directive is used to check if a variable is defined or not. It allows you to conditionally evaluate parts of the makefile based on whether a variable has been defined.

example syntax:
ifdef variable
    # Statements to execute if the variable is defined
else
    # Statements to execute if the variable is not defined
endif
